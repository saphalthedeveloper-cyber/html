    <h1>Learn Guitar</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>step 1 <br>
            Learn these open chords: E, A, D, G, C, Em, Am.<br>
            Practice switching between two chords slowly (e.g., Em ↔ G).<br>
            Play simple down-strum on each chord (4 beats per chord).
        </li>
        <li>step 2 <br>

            Work on smooth chord changes using a metronome.<br>
            Learn a couple of strumming patterns: steady downbeats, then down-up patterns. <br>
            Start playing 2–3 simple songs that use only 2–4 chords.
        </li>
        <li>step 3 <br>

            Blend rhythm and lead: play rhythm while adding simple fills.<br>
            Work on fingerstyle or Travis picking (if interested).<br>
            Learn basic music theory: intervals, key, how chords fit in a key.<br>
            Play with backing tracks / jam with others.<br>
        </li>
